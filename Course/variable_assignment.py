'''
Variables are memory locations that store values
Syntax is: name assign value eg. age = 20
'''

# single variable assignment
age = 20 # int
print (age)
sentence = "My name is Adam" # string in quotes
print (sentence)

# multiple variable assignment
# makes your python code faster and easier
sarah, bob, mike = 16, 21, 17 # multiple variables and values
print (sarah,bob,mike)
sarah = bob = mike = 17 # multiple variables and one value
print (sarah, bob, mike)

'''
Practice exercise:
Write a single line of code with variables for your
name and age
'''
name, age = "Adam", 43 # string and integer
print (name,age)

# end of code
