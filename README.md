## Python Introduction

### Overview
This repository contains the projects and exercises from my journey through the Complete Python Programming Bootcamp coruse. It serves as a record of my learning process, focusing filling gaps in my Python knowledge to build a strong foundation.

### Course Folder
The Course Folder includes coding exercises from the Complete Python Programming Bootcamp course. These exercises cover key topics such as:

* Variables (single and multiple assignment)

Each exercise is aimed at reinforcing foundational skills and understanding core concepts in Python.

### Programs Folder
The Programs Folder contains my own Python programs, created to apply the concepts learned in the course. These projects go beyond the course exercises to demonstrate my passion programming. This is where I can really stretch my programming legs and explore all my cool ideas.

* Python MIDI tool - coming soon!

Each program reflects my growing confidence in writing clean, functional Python code.
