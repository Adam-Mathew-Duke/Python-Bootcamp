## The Complete Python Programming Bootcamp ([View Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/pythonbootcamp/?couponCode=OF83024F))

### Overview
This repository features projects and exercises from my journey through the Complete Python Programming Bootcamp. It documents my learning process, focusing on filling knowledge gaps and building a strong foundation in Python.

Includes coding exercises from the course materials. These exercises cover key topics such as:

* Variables (single and multiple assignment)
* Arithmetic operations (on numbers and strings)
* String placeholders (%s from string and %d for integer)
* Strings Operations and Strings exercise (end of lesson challenge)
* Lists
* Dictionaries (each key in a dictionary must be unique - like a primary key in a database)

Each exercise is aimed at reinforcing foundational skills and understanding core concepts in Python.
