### Overview
This repository features projects and exercises from my journey through the Complete Python Programming Bootcamp. It documents my learning process, focusing on filling knowledge gaps and building a strong foundation in Python.

Includes coding exercises from the course materials. These exercises cover key topics such as:

* Variables (single and multiple assignment)
* Arithmetic operations (on numbers and strings)
* String placeholders (%s from string and %d for integer)
* Strings Operations and Strings exercise (end of lesson challenge)
* Lists[]
* Dictionaries{} (each key must be unique)
* Tuples() (similar to lists but are immutable)
* List[], dictionaries{} and tuples()
* Conditional statments (if, else, elif)
* For loops (iterate of items in a data structure like a list, or with the range function range (0,51,5)

Each exercise is aimed at reinforcing foundational skills and understanding core concepts in Python.
